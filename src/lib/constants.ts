    prompt: 'Give me a small overview of the C++ programming language',
    content: `**C++ Overview**
================

C++ is a high-performance, object-oriented programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs in the 1980s. It was designed to be a successor to the C programming language, adding features such as classes, templates, operator overloading, and object-oriented programming (OOP).

### Key Features

* **High-Performance**: C++ is a compiled language, offering direct access to hardware resources, making it a popular choice for systems programming, games development, and other high-performance applications.
* **Object-Oriented**: C++ supports encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, making it a popular choice for complex software development.
* **Statically Typed**: C++ is compiled at compile-time, catching type errors and allowing for compile-time evaluation of expressions.
* **Platform-Portability**: C++ code can be compiled on various platforms, making it a widely-used language for cross-platform development.

### Syntax and Structure

C++ code is written in a syntax similar to C, with additional features such as:

* **Classes**: Define custom data types and behaviors using the \`class\` keyword.
* **Functions**: Define reusable blocks of code using the \`function\` keyword.
* **Pointers**: Access memory locations using pointers.
* **Templates**: Define generic functions and classes using the \`template\` keyword.

### Popular Use Cases

* **Systems Programming**: C++ is widely used for systems programming, embedded systems, and game development.
* **High-Performance Computing**: C++ is used in scientific computing, numerical simulations, and data analytics.
* **Cross-Platform Development**: C++ is used for developing applications that run on multiple platforms, such as Windows, Linux, and macOS.

### Getting Started

To get started with C++, you'll need:

* A C++ compiler (such as \`g++\` or \`clang\`)
* A text editor or IDE (such as Visual Studio Code or Eclipse)
* A basic understanding of programming concepts (such as variables, loops, and functions)`,
